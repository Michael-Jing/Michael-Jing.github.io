I have a degree in Mechanical Engineering. I have some experience in Machine Learning, Risk Control for online financial services, Real-time data infrastructure (OSIsoft PI System specifically), Computer  Vison and Deep Learning. Now I really want to focus on Deep Learning.

I usually go to swimming in my spare time and my best record is 24m44s for 1km. There's still much room for improvement, I know that.
