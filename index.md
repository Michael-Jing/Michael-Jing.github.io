Welcome to Michael Jing's blog

I am a software developer with experience on Java, Python and Scala, bash etc. 
I am interested in AI and spend lots of time on Udacity and Coursera to learn AI 
related courses. Currently I am learning the Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree and Deep 
Learning Foundation Nanodegree. As to my education background, 
I have a Bachelor's degree on Mechanical Engineering and Automation. 

I started to blogging recently, so the following are my blogs.

## [How to generate permutations](leetcode/permutations.md)
