is Column-Oriented Storage? In Contrast to Row-Oriented Storage, each column of data is stored in\na seperate file, and all the column files store rows in the same order.\nColumn Compression\nValues in a column often look quite repetitive, so they can be compressed.\nBitmap Encoding\nwe can take a column with n distinct values and turn it into n separate bitmaps: one bitmap for each distinct value, with one bit for each row. The bit is 1 if the row has that value, and 0 if not.\nRun-length encoding\nIn run-length encoding, a sequence of \"0, 4, 12, 2\" stands for 0 zeros, 4 ones, 12 zeros, 2 ones.\nUsing bitmap encoding, bitwise operation can be use to speed up queries.\nColumn families are row-oriented: within each column family, they store all columns from a row\ntogether, along with a row key, and they do not use column compression.\nMemory bandwitdth and vectorized processing\nColumn compression allows more rows from a column to fit in the same amount of L1 cache. Operators, such as bitwise AND and OR, can be designed to operate on such chunks of compressed column data directly.\nSort Order in Column Storage\nWe can choose to impose an order on rows, and use that as an indexing mechanism. A second column can determine the sort order of any rows that have the same value in the first column. Another advantage of sorted\norder is that it can help with compression of columns.\nSeveral different sort orders\nDifferent queries benefit from different sort orders, so why not store the same data sorted in several different ways? Data needs to be replicated to multiple machines anyway.\nWriting to Column-Oriented Storage\nWrite data to an in-memory store first and then merge the in-memory store with the column files  on disk\nand written to new files in bulk.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/column-oriented-storage/","title":"Column-Oriented Storage"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/high-performance-python/":{"body":"High Performance Python\nBenchmarking &amp; Profiling\nTest &amp; Benchmarking\n\ntiem command\ntimeit module in Python\npytest-benchmark\ntimeit as a decorator\ntimeit as a context manager\n\nFind Bottlenecks\n\ncProfile\nline_profiler\nmemory_profiler\n\nThreads Synchronization\nSynchronization primitives\n\njoin\nLock\nRLcok\n\n谁拿谁放\n同一线程多次拿到\n拿多少次放多少次\n\n\ncondition\nsemaphores\nEvents\nbarrier\n\nConcurrent DS\nThread-safe in Python\n\nqueue\n\nQueue\nLifoQueue\nPriorityQueue\n\n\nDeque\n\nNot Thread-safe in Python\n\nSet\nList\n\nMake Non Thread-safe Thread-safe\n\nExtend\ndecorator for method\ndecorator for class\n\nExecutors &amp; Pools\nBased on\n\nThreads\nProcess\n\nApis\n\nfor test\n\nset_exception\nset_result\nset_running_notify_cancel\n\n\nshutdown\n\nexecutor.shutdown\n\n\nfuture objects apis\n\nquery\n\nrunning\ndone\nresult\nexception\nas_completed\n\n\ncontrol\n\nadd_done_callback\ncancel\n\n\n\n\n\nProcesses\nCreate\n\nmultiprocessing.Process\nInherit class Process\n\nApis\n\nname\ndaemon\nterminate\n\nSynchronization\n\nLock\nRlock\nCondition\nSemaphore\nEvent\nBarrier\n\nCommunicate\n\nQueue\nPipe\n\nbidirectional\n\nmultiprocessing.Pipe\n\n\nunidirectional\n\nos.pipe\n\n\n\n\nManager\nmultiprocessing.connection\n\nPool\n\napply &amp; apply_async\nmap &amp; map_async\nstarmap &amp; starmap_async\nImap &amp; Imap_unordered\nmaxtaskperchild\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/high-performance-python/","title":"High Performance Python"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/home-directoy-is-full/":{"body":"We share GPU box and we use anaconda to manage our Python environments these days.

This configuration is called semi-synchronous sometimes.\n\n\nAsynchronous\n\nAdvantage: the leader can continue processing writes, even if all of its followers have fallen behind.\nDisadvantage: poential data loss.\nI may study chain replication if I have time.\n\n\n\nSetting Up New Followers\n\nTake a consistent snapshot of the leader's database at some point in time - if possible, without taking a lock on the entire database.\nCopy the snapshot to the new follewer node.\nThe follower connects to the leader and requests all the data changes since the snapshot was taken. The snapshot is associated with an exact position in the leader's replication log.\nWhen the follower has processed the backlog of data changes since the snapshot, we say it has caught up.\n\nHandling Node Outages\n\nFollower Failure: Catch-up recovery\nconnect to the leader and requst all the data changes since that last transaction before the outage.\nLeader failure: Failover\n\nDeterming that the leader has failed\nChoosing a new leader\nReconfiguring the system to use the new leader. (the old leader may still believe that it is the leader)\n\nFailover is fraught with things that can go wrong:\n\n\nIf asynchronous replication is used, the new leader may have fallen behind, and there maybe conflicts if the former leader rejoins the cluster.\nDiscarding writes is dangerous if other storage systems outside of the database need to be coordinated with the database contents.\nSplit brain: if both leaders accept writes, and there is no process for resolving conflicts, data is likely to be lost or corrupted.\nWhat is the right timeout\n\n\n\nImplementationof Replication Logs\n\n\nStatemen-based replication\n\nthere are various ways in which this approach can break down:\n\nStatement that calls a nondeterministic function, such as NOW()\nIf statements use an autoincrementing column, or if they dpend on the existing data in the database, they must be executed in exactly the same order on each replica.\nStatements that have side effects(e.g., triggers, stored procedures, user-defined functions) unless they are absolutely deterministic.\n\n\n\nWrite-ahead log(WAL) shipping\n\nDisadvantage: a WAL contains details of which bytes were changed in which disk blocks. This makes replication closely coupled to the storage engine.\n\n\nLogical (row-based) log replication\n\nA logical log for a relational database is usually a sequence of records describing writes to database tables at the granularity of a row.\n\n\nTrigger-based replication\nRegister custom application code that is automatically executed when a data change occures.\n\n\nProblems with Replication Lag\n\nReading Your Own Writes\n\nWhen reading something that the user may have modified, read it from the leader.\nTrack the time of the last update and, for one minute after the last update, make all reads from the leader.\nThe client can remember the timestamp (logical or actual system clock) of its most recent write - then the system can ensure that the replica serving any reads for that user reflects updates at least until that timestamp.\n\nAnother complication arises when the same user is accessing your service from multiple devices. In this case you may want to provide cross-device read-after-write consistency. In this case, there are some additional issues to consider:\nApproaches that require remembering the timestamp of the user's last update become more difficult, because code running on one device doesn't know what updates have happened on the other device. This metadata will need to be centralized\n\n\nMonotonic Reads\nThe issue is if a user first reads from fresh replica, then from a stale replica, Time appears to go backward.\n\nMake sure each user always read from the same replica.\nConsistent Prefix Reads\n\n\n\nConsistent prefix reads guarantees that if a sequence of writes happens in a certain order, then anyone reading those writes will see them in the same order.\n\nOne solution is to make sure that any wirtes that are causally related to each other are written to the same partition.\nSolutions for Replication Lag\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/leader-based-replication/","title":"Leader Based Replication"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/linearizability/":{"body":"What is linearizability? The basic idea is make a system appear as if there were only one copy of the data,\nand all operations on it are atomic.\nWhat makes a system linerizable\n\nRead operation completes before a write operation begins, must return the old value\nRead operation begins after a write operation has completed, must return the new value\nAny read operations that overlap with a write operation, might return either the new or the old value\nAfter any read has returned the new value, all following reads (on the same or other clients) must return the new value\n\nLinearizability Versus Serializability\nLinerizability is a rencency guarantee on reads and writes of a register (on individual object). It does not group operations into transactions, so it does not prevent problems such as write skew.\nA database may provide both serializability and linearizability. Implementations of serilizability based on 2 phase locking or actual serial execution are typically linerizable while serializable snapshot isolation is not linearizable.\nRelying on Linearizability\n\nLocking and leader election\nConstraints and uniqueness guarantees\nCross-channel timing dependencies\n\nImplementing Linearizable Systems\nSingle-leader replication (potentially linearizable)\nThis configuration is linerizable if you reads from the leader or synchronously updated followers.\n\npotential issues:\n\nIf a delusional leader continues to serve requests, it is likely to violate linearizability.\nWith asychronous replication, failover may loose commited writes, which violates both linearizability and durability\n\nConsensus algorithms (linearizable)\nMulti-leader replication (not linearizable)\nLeaderless replication (probably not linearizable)\nIt's possible to make Dynamo-style quorums linearizable at the cost of reduced performance. A reader must perform read repair synchronously, before returning results to the application, and a writer must read the state of a quorum of nodes before sending its writes.\nThe cost of linearizability\n\nWhen a network fault occurs, you have to choose between either linearizability or total availability\nLinearizability is slow, it's true all the time. If you want linearizability, the response time of read and write is at least proportional to the uncertainty of delays in the network.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/linearizability/","title":"Linearizability"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/multi-leader-replication/":{"body":"A natural extension of the leader-based replication model is to allow more than one node to accepts, which requires Multi-Leader Replication.

The more that a storage engine writes to disk, the fewer writes per second it can handle within the available disk bandwidth.\n\n\nLSM-trees are typically able to sustain higher write throughput than B-trees, partly because they sometimes have lower write amplification (depends on the storage engine configuration and workload), and partly because they sequentially write SSTable files\n\n\nLSM-trees can be compressed better\n\n\nSSD firmware may use a log-structured algorithm to turn random writes into sequential wirtes\n\n\nDownsides of LSM-trees\n\nThe compaction process can sometimes interfere with the performance of ongoing reads and writes. the response time of queries to log-structured storage engines can sometimes be quite high\nAt high write throughput, the compaction may cannot keep up with the rate of incoming writes.\nAn advantage of B-trees is that each key exists in exactly one place, so transaction isolation is easier.\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/sstables-and-lsm-trees/","title":"SSTables and LSM-Trees"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/tablebank/":{"body":"I am currently working on table detection and I will use this post to keep a memo of things I learned\nin the process\nSystem Requirement\nI finally installed detectron successfully, but I think that use a prebuilt docker image is the easiest way to get started, a Dockerfile is located in the docker folder\n\nPython2 with conda\nCaffe2\nInstall Caffe2 by installing prebuilt pytorch binary\n\nconda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=9.0 -c pytorch\n\n\n\nCocoapi\n\n# COCOAPI=/path/to/clone/cocoapi\ngit clone https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git $COCOAPI\ncd $COCOAPI/PythonAPI\npip install cython\n# Install into global site-packages\nmake install\n# Alternatively, if you do not have permissions or prefer\n# not to install the COCO API into global site-packages\npython setup.py install --user\n\n\n\nDetectron\n\ngit clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron\npip install -r detectron/requirements.txt\ncd detectron &amp;&amp; make\n# in order to not accidently interfier with others, use CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES to specify the gpu you want to use\npython detectron/detectron/tests/test_spatial_narrow_as_op.py\nInference with Tablebank pretrained model\npython tools/infer_simple.py --cfg $CONFIG_MODEL --output-dir /tmp/detectron-tablebank --image-ext jpg \\\n    --wts $MODEL_PATH /home/shr/TableBank/data/Sampled_Detection_data/Latex/images\n\n\nDownload weights and configuration file from [Model Zoo]\n\nResources\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/tablebank/","title":"Table Detection"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/column-oriented-storage/":{"body":195,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/high-performance-python/":{"body":128,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/home-directoy-is-full/":{"body":54,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/leader-based-replication/":{"body":432,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/linearizability/":{"body":201,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/multi-leader-replication/":{"body":159,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/ocr-summary/":{"body":119,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/ordering-guarantees/":{"body":274,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/partitioning/":{"body":1,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/python-threads/":{"body":40,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/sstables-and-lsm-trees/":{"body":353,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/tablebank/":{"body":124,"title":2}},"length":14},"lang":"English"};
